What are the forces driving The Next Age of change in our 
industry? In the 21st Century, we are going to see 
eye-opening solutions to ordinary, everyday problems brought
about through creatively applying efficiency, resource
optimization, predictive analytics, automation and other
technologies. 

Operational Technology. Infrastructure Modernization. 
Sustainability. These forces are converging to reshape our
industries, the future of our cities and the environment
around us. The Next Age is still being shaped and defined,
but it is clear that technology and industry are coming
together to change our world once again. 

Join Schneider Electric on September 11 as we gather
influencers from across our industry to discuss and debate
the forces that will define The Next Age.
